# Fix Instruments and Mixing

## Tasks
- [ ] Add audioContext.resume() in drum click handlers to enable sound playback
- [ ] Define handleTalkingDrumClick function to play talking drum sounds
- [ ] Implement quantizeNotes with swing for better beat timing
- [ ] Implement analyzeRecordingsForBeat to analyze note patterns
- [ ] Implement createAdaptiveBackingBeat for different beat patterns
- [ ] Implement addBeatVariations for human feel
- [ ] Implement addSpecialEffectsToMix for distortion effects
- [ ] Test instruments play sound
- [ ] Test mixing produces realistic beat

## Information Gathered
- Audio files are present in the directory
- Audio context needs user interaction to resume
- Talking drum click handler is missing
- Mixing functions are stubbed and need implementation
- Quantization and swing will improve beat realism
- Special effects like distortion can enhance the mix

## Plan
1. Edit scripts.js to add audio context resume in drum interactions
2. Define handleTalkingDrumClick with appropriate sound mapping
3. Implement missing mixing functions with beat enhancements
4. Test functionality

## Followup
- Verify instruments produce sound on click
- Test recording and mixing features
- Ensure beat sounds natural with swing and variations
